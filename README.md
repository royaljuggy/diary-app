# Diary App
 A diary app on the web! Easy to use and save old entries!
 
## How to use it
Type something into the first input box. Anything message you'd like to save works. Before you hit submit, you may specify using the dropdown menu which of the 10 saved items 
you'd like to save your new message to. These 10 saved items are stored in-browser and can be accessed ever after you close the browser! If no entry number is specified, the
website will randomly save your message to one of the 10 spots. Hit submit. Now you have two options: view your entry from today using the button below the "view today's entries" text, or, select an entry number with the dropdown menu and hit old entry! Try it and let me know if you find any bugs!
